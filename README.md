Today is less about learning and more about doing.  I'll reference and borrow external code, etc.  I want an optimized NFT template I can quickly clone and expand for my future NFT projects, of which I have at least... 4? on my plate.

For starters, I need my SVG framework to work.  I also want to explore merkle airdrop, and gelato auto-mint.
